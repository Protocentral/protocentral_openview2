# Protocentral OpenView 2

Openview 2 is designed as a companion application to receive data from various Protocentral boards. Openview can be used to visualize the data in real-time and also store the data in CSV format. Openview 2 is designed to be compatible with multiple boards and can be easily extended to support new boards. OpenView 2 will replace the existing [OpenView app](https://github.com/Protocentral/protocentral_openview2) written in Processing and will be the primarily supported app for all Protocentral boards. OpenView 2 is based on the more modern [Flutter framework](https://flutter.dev/) and is available for Windows, MacOS, Linux, Android, and iOS.

The Android and iOS mobile versions use BLE to connect to the boards (when used with a microcontroller with BLE support), while the desktop version uses USB/UART to connect to the boards. 

## Features:

* Multiple boards, one unified interface
* Mobile platforms: Android and iOS
* Desktop platforms: Windows, MacOS, and Linux
* Code development environment: [Flutter](https://flutter.dev/)
* Data storage option to CSV files
* You can add your own board by editing the source (for now, in the future we will add a more configurable way to add new boards)

## Supported Boards
* [HealthyPi 5](https://protocentral.com/product/healthypi-5-vital-signs-monitoring-hat-kit/)
* [HealthyPi Move](https://www.crowdsupply.com/protocentral/healthypi-move)
