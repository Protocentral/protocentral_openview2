    The definition of Open Source Hardware according to the Open Source Hardware Association (OSHWA) www.oshwa.org is:

    ‚ÄúOpen source hardware is hardware whose design is made publicly available
    so that anyone can study, modify, distribute, make, and sell the design or hardware based on that design.
    The hardware‚Äôs source, the design from which it is made, is available in the preferred format for making modifications to it.‚Äù
